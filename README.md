# Bulk documenation generator


## Assumption of the project
Once a year there is an update of salaries for employees at court. Issue raised was that the process of calculating new salaries as well as
creating the documents which are then shared with employees were done completely manually. I came up with an idea of automating this process.

Input of the file is the extract from SAP system with relevant details about employees (NOTE: example CSV file is just some random data create for presentation purposes)

## Technologies
* Python (pandas)
* HTML and CSS (to style the document)
